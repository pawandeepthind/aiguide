            The <b>dreadnought</b> was the predominant type of battleship in the
            early 20th century. The first of the kind, the Royal Navy's HMS
            Dreadnought, had such an effect when launched in 1906 that similar
            battleships built after her were referred to as "dreadnoughts", and
            earlier battleships became known as pre-dreadnoughts. Her design had
            two revolutionary features: an "all-big-gun" armament scheme, with
            an unprecedented number of heavy-calibre guns, and steam turbine
            propulsion.[a] As dreadnoughts became a crucial symbol of national
            power, the arrival of these new warships renewed the naval arms race
            between the United Kingdom and Germany. Dreadnought races sprang up
            around the world, including in South America, lasting up to the
            beginning of World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in
            size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and
            propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new
            battleships outclassed Dreadnought herself. These more powerful
            vessels were known as "super-dreadnoughts". Most of the original
            dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the
            terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, but many of the newer
            super-dreadnoughts continued serving throughout World War II.

            Dreadnought-building consumed vast resources in the early 20th
            century, but there was only one battle between large dreadnought
            fleets. At the Battle of Jutland in 1916, the British and German
            navies clashed with no decisive result. The term "dreadnought"
            gradually dropped from use after World War I, especially after the
            Washington Naval Treaty, as virtually all remaining battleships
            shared dreadnought characteristics; it can also be used to describe
            battlecruisers, the other type of ship resulting from the
            dreadnought revolution.[1]

            The distinctive all-big-gun armament of the dreadnought was
            developed in the first years of the 20th century as navies sought to
            increase the range and power of the armament of their battleships.
            The typical battleship of the 1890s, now known as the
            "pre-dreadnought", had a main armament of four heavy guns of 12-inch
            (300 mm) calibre, a secondary armament of six to eighteen
            quick-firing guns of between 4.7-and-7.5-inch (119 and 191 mm)
            calibre, and other smaller weapons. This was in keeping with the
            prevailing theory of naval combat that battles would initially be
            fought at some distance, but the ships would then approach to close
            range for the final blows (as they did in the Battle of Manila Bay),
            when the shorter-range, faster-firing guns would prove most useful.
            Some designs had an intermediate battery of 8-inch (203 mm) guns.
            Serious proposals for an all-big-gun armament were circulated in
            several countries by 1903.[2]

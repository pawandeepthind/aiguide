            <b>Mayflower</b> was an English ship that transported a group of
            English families, known today as the Pilgrims, from England to the
            New World in 1620. After a grueling 10 weeks at sea, Mayflower, with
            102 passengers and a crew of about 30, reached what is today the
            United States, dropping anchor near the tip of Cape Cod,
            Massachusetts, on November 21 [O.S. November 11], 1620.

            Differing fromasdasd their contemporaries, the Puritans (who sought
            to reform and purify the Church of England), the Pilgrims chose to
            separate themselves from the Church of England, which forced them to
            pray in private. They believed it was beyond redemption due to its
            resistance to reform and Roman Catholic past. Starting in 1608, a
            group of English families left England for the Netherlands, where
            they could worship freely. By 1620, the community determined to
            cross the Atlantic for America, which they considered a "new
            Promised Land", where they would establish Plymouth Colony.[1]: 44

            The Pilgrims had originally hoped to reach America by early October
            using two ships, but delays and complications meant they could use
            only one, Mayflower. Arriving in November, they had to survive
            unprepared through a harsh winter. As a result, only half of the
            original Pilgrims survived the first winter at Plymouth. If not for
            the help of local indigenous peoples to teach them food gathering
            and other survival skills, all of the colonists might have perished.
            The following year, those 53 who survived[2] celebrated the colony's
            first fall harvest along with 90 Wampanoag Native American
            people,[3] an occasion declared in centuries later the first
            American Thanksgiving.[4] Before disembarking the Mayflower, the
            Pilgrims wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact, an agreement that
            established a rudimentary government, in which each member would
            contribute to the safety and welfare of the planned settlement. As
            one of the earliest colonial vessels, the ship has become a cultural
            icon in the history of the United States.[5]

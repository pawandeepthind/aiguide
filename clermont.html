            <b>The North River Steamboat</b> or North River, colloquially known
            as the Clermont, is widely regarded as the world's first vessel to
            demonstrate the viability of using steam propulsion for commercial
            water transportation.[2] Built in 1807, the North River Steamboat
            operated on the Hudson River – at that time often known as the North
            River – between New York City and Albany, New York. It was built by
            the wealthy investor and politician Robert Livingston and inventor
            and entrepreneur Robert Fulton (1765–1815).

            Livingston had obtained Livingston had obtained from the New York
            legislature the exclusive right to steam navigation on the Hudson
            River. In 1803, while Livingston was Minister to France, Fulton's
            company built a small steamboat and tested it on the Seine. With
            this success, Livingston then contracted with Fulton to take
            advantage of his Hudson River monopoly and build a larger version
            for commercial service.

            Their larger steamer was built at the Charles Browne shipyard in New
            York and was fitted with Fulton's innovative steam engine design,
            manufactured for Livingston and Fulton by Boulton and Watt in
            Birmingham, England. Before she was later widened, the vessel's
            original dimensions were 150 feet (46 m) long × 12 feet (3.7 m) wide
            × 7 feet (2.1 m) deep; she drew a little more than 2 feet (60 cm) of
            water when launched. The steamer was equipped with two paddle
            wheels, one each to a side; each paddle wheel assembly was equipped
            with two sets of eight spokes. She also carried two masts with
            spars, rigging, and sails, likely a foremast with square sail and a
            mizzen mast with fore-and-aft sail (spanker), with the steam engine
            placed amidships, directly behind the paddle wheel's drive gear
            machinery.[citation needed]

            My first steamboat "My first steamboat on the Hudson's River was 150
            feet long, 13 feet wide, drawing 2 ft. of water, bow and stern 60
            degrees: she displaced 36.40 [sic] cubic feet, equal 100 tons of
            water; her bow presented 26 ft. to the water, plus and minus the
            resistance of 1 ft. running 4 miles an hour."[3]: 192  Fulton's
            published specifications after Steamboat's widening and general
            rebuild:[citation needed] <br /><br />* Length: 142 feet (43 m)
            <br />* Maximum width: 18 feet (4.3 m) <br />* Maximum height: 62
            feet (19 m) <br />* Depth: 7 feet (2.1 m)<br />
            * Displacement: 121 tons <br />* Average speed: 4.7 miles per hour
            <br />* Time saved: 150 miles in 32 hours <br />* The paddle wheels
            were 4 feet (1.2 m) wide and 15 feet (4.6 m) in diameter.
            <br /><br />In the Nautical Gazette the editor, Mr. Samuel Ward
            Stanton, gives the following additional details: The bottom of the
            boat was formed of yellow pine plank 1.5 in. thick, tongued and
            grooved, and set together with white lead. This bottom or platform
            was laid in a transverse platform and molded out with batten and
            nails. The shape of the bottom being thus formed, the floors of oak
            and spruce were placed across the bottom; the spruce floors being
            4×8 inches and 2 feet apart. The oak floors were reserved for the
            ends, and were both sided and molded 8 inches. Her top timbers
            (which were of spruce and extended from a log that formed the bridge
            to the deck) were sided 6 inches and molded at heel, and both sided
            and molded 4 inches at the head. She had no guards when first built
            and was steered by a tiller. Her draft of water was 28
            inches.[3]: 192  The boat had three cabins with 54 berths, kitchen,
            larder, pantry, bar, and steward's room.[3]: 342
